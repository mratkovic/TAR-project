# Author profiling

TASK:
You will tackle the task of inferring information about an author of a text by analysing their
writing style. You will work with a dataset of twitter profiles. For each profile, you will
get information about the gender and age-group.

Your task will be to build a classification model for each of these traits.
Moreover, for each profile you will also get a numerical rating for the following properties:
    - extroverted
    - stable
    - agreeable
    - conscientious
    - open

Your second task will be to develop regression models that predict this information for a
new profile. You should experiment with different machine learning algorithms and
features to determine what works best for each subtask.
